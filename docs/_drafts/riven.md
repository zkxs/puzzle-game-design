Cyan has clearly learned from the mistakes of Myst, as Riven's puzzles are much better designed. Notably, the frustrating brute-forcible puzzles are gone. Instead, Riven's most frustrating aspect is how it punishes the player for failing to observe inconspicuous details. Riven has a number of small, important items that are very easy to miss. In some cases, perhaps most notably the lever that grants access to the top of the giant golden dome, it becomes harder to find the longer it's been since you missed it. This is because the lever is in a hall, and once players believe they are familiar with a hall they click through it very quickly. All of the other cases of inconspicuous levers and doors in Riven have some sort of tell that indicates there's an area the player needs to get to, leading back to the easy-to-miss button or door. The top of the golden dome has no such tell.

The takeaway is that with Riven, Cyan took the idea of Myst and simply added incredible polish. The puzzles are better designed, more interconnected, and feel like they're seamlessly part of the world.
