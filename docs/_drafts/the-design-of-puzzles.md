I've already talked about [the design of adventure puzzle games]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2022-03-02-the-design-of-adventure-puzzle-games %}), so now lets take a deeper dive into individual puzzles.

- What are the stages of a puzzle
  - information gathering
    - before you see the puzzle
    - after you see the puzzle
  - identification
    - is it immediately obvious that this thing is a puzzle?
    - is there some sort of knowledge required to know this is a puzzle?
    - conversely, do you have things that *aren't* puzzles that might be mistaken for puzzles?
  - execution
  - payoff
- What makes a puzzle fun?
  - Breakthrough moment where you realize how to solve it
  - Executing the solution
  - Whatever payoff the game gives you
    - What if the game "rewards" you with something you don't want? Like a lore dump where the player doesn't care?
- What happens if the player doesn't know what to do?
  - Is that on them? Should they feel bad?
  - Is there a hint system?
    - This could be a direct "help me" button
    - This could also be much more subtle
      - Repetition of themes can train players in what's expected of them, so they'll "get it" when they revisit the puzzle
      - Scatter hints around the world, so as they explore more they have more and more prods to a puzzle
  - Is there something else they can do while their brain subconsciously works on it?
  - Is the puzzle optional?
- What is the experience you want your player to have?
  - How do you build something that provides that experience?
  - What happens if something goes wrong?
