Some quick and dirty outer wilds notes.

## Things you really shouldn't know

### The eye's coordinates

- The eye coordinates:
  1. `L` tilted clockwise slightly
  2. Hourglass minus bottom
  3. `N` but with swag

### The password from the Symbol Room
  4. `)` crescent
  5. Saturn
  6. `)` crescent
  7. `+` star
  8. `+` star

### Subterranean Lake Map

```
           Starlit Cove ← [2]

Shrouded Woodlands ← [1]   •   [3] → Endless Canyon

                          [4] → The seals
```
Silly trivia: the seals don't point towards their matching forbidden archives

## Achievements

### Beginner's Luck
Reach the Eye of the universe in one loop.

NOTE: If you die at any point, you need to quit and start a new expedition again, this needs to be done in a single loop. 

1. Speedrun to Launch codes
2. Get distress signal at ember twin
3. Loiter until ash twin is empty enough
4. Slam jam your ship between the warp towers
5. Steal that fucking core
6. Bramble escape pod
7. Scout the fucking seed
8. Slide into the vessel
9. WIN

### Ghosts in the Machine
Reach all 3 Forbidden Archives in a single loop without getting caught.

You must take each archive's elevator for it to count as visited. In the Shrouded Woodlands case this means you may have to take the elevator *up* for credit, depending on if you route it last.

Travelling in the dream, vs traveling in the stranger?
- I don't think we have to do it in one consecutive dream. If we do the route is a bit more cursed.
  - The process
    1. Start at area A
    2. Open dock A, wake up
    3. Travel from area A to area B IRL
    4. Open dock B, wake up
    5. Travel from area B to area C IRL
    6. Do archive C, backtrack to dock C
    7. Raft to dock A, do archive A, backtrack to dock A
    8. Raft to dock B, do archive B
  - Steps broken down by region:
    - A: open dock, do archive from dock, backtrack to dock
    - B: open dock, do archive from dock
    - C: do archive from spawn, backtrack to dock
  - Steps broken down by step:
    - 2X open dock, abort
    - 1X do archive from spawn
    - 2X do archive from dock
    - 2X backtrack to dock
- Therefore, we assume we can wake up as long as we don't get *caught*

The archives:
1. River Lowlands -> Shrouded Woodlands -> Tunnel Clip Trick
   - Through the fireplace
   - Can it be skipped via raft tunnel clipping?
   - Only doable after the dam is broken
   - The cannot be YOLO'd past.
   - ENTRANCE: blow open a door
2. Cinder Isles -> Starlit Cove -> Dead IRL Trick
   - You NEED to be dead to do this efficiently. Therefore, we have two options:
     - Do it last
     - Leave without death warping
   - ENTRANCE: light boathouse after going a teensy bit CW around the ring
   - No invisible bridges
3. Hidden Gorge -> Endless Canyon -> Ditch Lantern Trick
   - Quick entrance as well as last to fall in water makes it a strong start option
   - Hop through the painting to skip a bunch of bullshit and immediately darken shit
   - Take the second invisible bridge to skip some bullshit?
   - ENTRANCE: must have lowered chain elevator

#### Multi-dream Route
1. Hidden Gorge -> Endless Canyon
   1. Left to secret tunnel fuckery, shortcut to turn off lights
   2. Right to bridge fuckery, shortcut past elevator
   3. Sneak past spooks and through painting
   5. Deathwarp
2. Die at Cinder Isles (Island Tower) -> Starlit Cove
   1. Hang a left and activate the dock
   2. Walk through Starlit Cove, ignoring alarms
   3. Backtrack to dock
   4. Raft to transition, yeet self into Shrouded Woodlands archive, take the elevator up
3. Done

Cost:
- 3 IRL quarter turns, pass the dam
- 1.5 dream quarter turns
- 1 archive -> dock backtracks

The drawbacks:
- Nothing

The benefits:
- Only one backtrack, and it's an easy one
- We do Endless Canyon, the most difficult bit, first
- Shrouded Woodlands is last, so the dam timing is good

#### One Dream Route
The gist: Unlock all the docks, then do cinder

1. Setup
   1. Go to Hidden Gorge, drop elevator at Endless Canyon dock, deathwarp
   2. Go to River Lowlands, open Shrouded Woodlands dock, deathwarp
2. Go to Cinder Isles (Island Tower), die at fire
3. Execute The Run
   1. Do Starlit Cove archive (low risk)
   2. Backtrack to dock, and go
   3. Skip the dream Sealed Vault (there's nothing for us there)
   4. Do Endless Canyon archive (medium risk)
   5. Backtrack to dock, and go
   6. Raft to transition, yeet self into Shrouded Woodlands archive, take the elevator up
4. Done

Cost:
- 3 IRL quarter turns, pass the dam
- 1.5 dream quarter turns
- 2 archive -> dock backtracks

The drawbacks:
- Have to backtrack through endless canyon

The benefits:
- Swag
- Shrouded Woodlands is last, so the dam timing is good

#### Perfected Route
After remembering you can warp to Shrouded Woodlands, a full redesign. Two options:
- One-dream is slightly more dangerous as you have to dodge a pursuer twice vs once, but you get the swag of doing all three archives in one dream
- Multi-dream is slightly safer for the aforementioned reason. It's not any slower due to the waiting-for-dam-to-break autoscroller.

1. Go in the normal entrance
2. Grab the artifact from the ghost matter shack
3. Proceed to the Island Tower
4. Sleep into the Starlit Cove
5. Hang a left and light the boathouse
6. Jump in to water to wake up
7. Raft to the Hidden Gorge
8. Sleep. If you're going for a one-dream run then die here instead.
9. Take the painting shortcut to extinguish the lights
10. Take the invisible bridge right of spawn to the elevator
11. Hug the right wall to YOLO past the camping pursuer and get to the archive
12. Backtrack to the elevator.
    - If you are dead IRL (one-dream run)
      1. Simply walk back to the elevator, again hugging the left wall and ignoring the camping pursuer
    - If you aren't dead IRL
      1. Jump in the water to deathwarp back
      2. Die at the fire
      3. Take the right invisible bridge back to the elevator
13. Take the elevator down to the dock
14. Raft into the area transition, and jump out
15. Walk into the only accessible archive
16. Call the elevator (it takes a while)
17. Take the elevator upstairs to the Shrouded Woodlands
18. WAIT inside the fireplace until the music stops. Don't fuck around with your light, because they'll see it and they'll totally walk through the fireplace and grab you.
19. Head to the dock
20. Raft to the Starlit Cove
21. Waltz in to the archive
    - You're dead, so ignore the alarms
    - There are no pursuers, even in the archive antechamber, so use your light freely and don't fall in the hole. The room is designed to fuck with you if you don't use your light.

Costs:
- Ghost matter shack
- 2.5 IRL quarter turn, no passing the dam
- 1.5 dream quarter turns
- 1 archive -> dock backtrack (2 if going for one dream swag)

The drawbacks:
- We don't get to use the cool hidden gorge entrance, and we have to use the *cringe* ghost matter shack instead.
- Shrouded Woodlands isn't last, meaning you might need to wait for the dam to break depending on how fast you go

The benefits:
- One unified route with only minor differences between multi-dream and one-dream
- Less IRL travel, and dodge the fucking dam entirely

## Freeing the Prisoner
Requirements:
1. Seal 1: Ditch lantern
2. Seal 2: Clip to it from a transition
3. Seal 3: Be dead
4. Sealed Vault -> Subterranean Lake  
   Need to end here. Can we get in from another area? Yes, we can get to it from the tunnel clip.

Potential Starting points:
- Hidden Gorge: buys you a lot of time, pretty short trip to the dream rafts
- River Lowlands: shortest trip to dream rafts?

### Route
1. Enter dream by dying at Hidden Gorge fire
2. Proceed directly to raft
   1. No need to put out lights
   2. Head right from start and take the invisible bridge to the elevator
3. Clip out of bounds from the raft
4. Water walk to Seal 2, and remove it for free
5. Take the raft to the coffin
6. Open Seal 1 by using your debug vision
7. Open Seal 3 by being dead (remember step 1?)
