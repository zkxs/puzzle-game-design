There's not a lot of great documentation out there on using Quest for PCVR. I'm going to write about my personal experiences switching from a Valve Index to a Meta Quest Pro. While this is written for Quest Pro, much of it should still be applicable for other Quest headsets.

Anyways, why'd I switch? In a word: eye and face tracking. I've written more on my research into present eye and face tracking options in [another post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-06-01-vr-facetracking %}) if you're interested.

## Quest Pro Accessories

The Index has a very strong experience right out of the box. Unfortunately, the Quest Pro has elects to provide certain things with accessories not included in the box. This means that unfortunately it's going to cost you a decent bit more than the cost of the Quest Pro alone.

Also, note that **you can get the 1st-party Meta accessories from other websites**, like Amazon. You might find different prices or faster shipping.

### Wireless

In order to go wireless you will want either a Wifi 6 (5GHz) or preferably a Wifi 6E (6GHz) access point. While Meta sells a [D-Link VR Air Bridge](https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/d-link-vr-air-bridge/) on their store it is only Wifi 6, requires custom software on your PC, and is not a normal access point. Therefore I recommend you instead get a normal Wifi 6E access point. I personally went with a [TP-Link AXE5400](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3SQK74L). Note that regardless of how they're advertised or if they have a one-click "access point mode", any wireless router can be used as an access point simply by disabling unneeded router features such as NAT and the DHCP server. [CNET has an adequate guide on this process](https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/how-to-turn-an-old-wi-fi-router-into-an-access-point/) if you need it.

Having a good wireless connection is extremely important to meet the high bandwidth requirements of video streaming, so it's recommended you have the access point with you in the room and dedicate it entirely to the Quest. Your PC should be connected to your network via an ethernet cable.

### Wired

If you don't want to go wireless for some reason, you'll need a [link cable](https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/link-cable/) and will need to use the Oculus software on your PC. I personally like ditching the cable tethering my head to my PC, and I'd advise you to go wireless as well if possible.

### Audio

The Quest Pro's stock speaker solution seems to prioritize looking really sleek, as it's hidden away in the headband instead of the dangling speakers the Index places right over your ears. If you want something that is higher quality *and* blocks surrounding noise, Meta sells [add-on earphones](https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/quest-pro-vr-earphones/). However, Meta has somehow [broken Steam Link compatibility with the earphones in firmware version 65](https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Get-Help/Steam-Link-Audio-not-working-with-latest-update/m-p/1200195/highlight/true#M307921) so **I cannot recommend you get these** until this is fixed in a future Quest Pro firmware or Steam Link update.

### Charging

By default all they give you is a little charging stand. This isn't great, as the Quest Pro has ~2 hours of battery life. You're going to want some sort of external charging solution for the USB-C port to stay in VR longer than that. Your options are either a long ass cable for wired charging or a pair of battery banks. You can keep one battery bank charging and one in your pocket to always trickle charge your Quest Pro. <!-- TODO battery size --> <!-- TODO charge wattages -->

### Comfort

Globular Cluster sells a [cushion/strap replacement](https://www.globular-cluster.com/QCOQPCF01.html) that is allegedly extremely comfortable. I'll update when mine arrives. <!-- TODO finish review AFTER you get it nerd -->

The Quest Pro does not have a built in face gasket like the Index, but it comes with some partial light blockers that attach to the sides of the headset. They're essentially horse blinders. They leave a large gap at the bottom of the headset however, and it's significantly larger than the Index's nose hole you may be used to peeking out of. If you wish the Index was easier to peek out of, then you don't need to do anything. If you like the level of light blocking the Index provides you'll want to pick up the [full light blocker](https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/quest-pro-full-light-blocker/). Meta alleges that this can impact the face tracking quality, but I didn't notice any measurable difference in face tracking with using the full light blocker.

## PCVR Connection

SteamLink is a free application that connects your Quest to a PC on the same network. Setup is very easy:

1. Install SteamLink on your Quest. You can get it from the Meta store.
2. Run Steam on your PC
3. Ensure you're on the same LAN as your PC
4. Start SteamLink on your Quest
5. Follow the instructions in your Quest to complete the link

Note that some people claim Virtual Desktop delivers higher quality video encoding than SteamLink, but Virtual Desktop costs $20 so I have not personally tested it.

The Quest Pro supports eye and face tracking. Setup for this is going to vary from game to game. For VRChat, see [VRCFaceTracking](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/hardware/quest-pro).

## Base Station Compatibility

Good news: if you have base-station tracked hardware it's possible to use it alongside your Quest Pro. Bad news: it takes a bit of setup and a bunch of 3rd party software.

### Aligning Playspaces

[OpenVR Space Calibrator](https://github.com/hyblocker/OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator) does voodoo witchcraft to align your Oculus and base station playspaces. There are several forks of this project: the one I've linked is the most recently updated and supports continuous calibration via mounting a Vive tracker to your headset. This isn't required, but it's less annoying that periodically doing the manual calibration, which involves holding a controller solidly against your headset and wobbling your head around. If you do plan on mounting a Vive tracker, I found that this [adhesive camera mount](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XBZ4T27) <!-- source: https://www.reddit.com/r/QuestPro/comments/1amrb9n/headset_tracker/kpoemuq/ --> works great, and its mounting surface is even slightly concave which works quite well with the convex plastic surface on the forehead part of the Quest Pro.

### Base Station Power Management

[OVR Lighthouse Manager](https://github.com/kurotu/OVR-Lighthouse-Manager) allows you to do power management on your base stations, which by default only works with Vive or Index headsets. You will need a Bluetooth LE 4.0 dongle to use this.

### Skipping the Quest Controllers

You may wish to use your base station tracked controllers instead of the Quest controllers. This means the only purpose of the Quest controllers is to open Steam Link, after which they serve no purpose and just clutter up SteamVR. You have two options to open Steam Link without a Quest controller:

1. Disable hand tracking, which will fall back to volume rocker input.
2. Sideload a patched Steam Link apk that supports hand tracking. There are old patched builds available, but this mod is no longer being maintained.

## New User Experience

I was pleasantly surprised to find that Meta doesn't seem very evil. Many people talk about not wanting to give Facebook or "The Zuck" their money, but the product is good and appears to be focused on privacy. The biggest complaint—mandatory Facebook account linking—is gone and has been replaced with a Meta account. I deleted my Facebook account years ago, and I was pleased to learn that creating a Meta account does not require a linked Facebook account.

During headset setup there are prompts asking if you want to allow data collection or not, and there were no dark patterns to prioritize the "wrong" choice. There is a permission system similar to smartphone apps to grant apps access to certain hardware features, such as camera, microphone, and more with the default permissions being very reasonable.

Horizon OS has some default apps installed in it by default with icons that can't be removed, which is annoying but not the end of the world as they can just be ignored. For example, there's some sort of Meta contacts thing, some kind of live feed, and of course Mark Zuckerberg's Metaverse.

The Quest insists on screeching at you every time you boot it if there are objects in your playspace... such as a beanbag chair. Yes, I know it's there. No, I don't care. Why do you keep asking me? If there's some way of disabling this prompt I sure haven't found it.

Oh, also you can just track your hands and interact with UI that way. It works surprisingly well and is nice if you don't feel like picking up your controllers, but the controllers still provide much more accurate control. You can uses this in VRChat on the native Quest application, but tragically it's not compatible with Steam Link presently. Apparently it works with Virtual Desktop, but I'm told it's a kludge that just emulates knuckles controllers.
