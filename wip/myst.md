# Myst Cheatsheet
## Clock Tower Puzzle
- You have exact control over the top and bottom gear
- The middle gear's position is the sum of the top and bottom offsets
- Modulo three
- This means (top-1 + bottom-1) % 3 = middle-1
- In other words, middle = (top + bottom) % 3 + 1
- so 3?3 is guaranteed to be 333 because 3 + 3 = 6, the the modulo gets us back to 3
- We're shooting for 221
- However, 2?1 is guaranteed to be 231
- Therefore, you're missing something
